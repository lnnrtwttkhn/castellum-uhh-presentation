## Current participant databases

::: {.fragment}
### The status quo

At the Institute of Psychology ...

::: {.incremental}
- 4 (of 11) groups have a participant database 
  - mostly used for "special" participant groups (children, participants with blindness or psychiatric disorders, etc.)
  - paper- or Excel-based with limited access by a few group members
  - Developmental Psychology group receives contact details from the Resident's Registration Office
  - various issues & concerns regarding the integration with Castellum (see discussion)
- Everyone else: ad-hoc recruitment via [SONA]({{< var links.sona >}}), [Stellenwerk]({{< var links.stellenwerk >}}), [Prolific]({{< var links.prolific >}}) (online studies only) or advertisement on campus
:::

:::

::: {.fragment}
### The goal

#### Excerpt from the [Digital Strategy]({{< var links.digital-strategy >}}) of the Faculty of Psychology and Human Movement Science (2022):

> "*We optimize the digital recruitment of study participants.
We have **access to a broad participant database** or platform through which participants can be **recruited according to specific criteria**.
We **clarify the requirements** for a platform for online studies, **evaluate alternative systems** and take care of the **technical integration**.*"<br>

# Update: Castellum at UHH

## Summary

::: {.fragment}

### Previously: Task force prepared roll-out of Castellum

- {{< fa square-check regular >}} Tasks force set up to plan roll-out of Castellum (see [https://lennartwittkuhn.com/castellum-uhh/](https://lennartwittkuhn.com/castellum-uhh/))
    - Monthly meetings from June 2023 to October 2023
    - Discussions and working (sub-)groups around the roll-out of Castellum
    - Examples: *"Who gets access to Castellum?"* *"How are users trained?"* *"What are the rules (e.g., for database maitanence)?"* *"Who supports recruitment campaigns?"* *"Who is responsible for data protection?"*
    - Result: First draft of Data Protection Whitepaper and general recommendations for shared use
- {{< fa square-check regular >}} Task force concluded work with recommendations / ideas for institute-wide use of Castellum
- {{< fa square-check regular >}} Technical setup in place
:::

:::

## Discussion

::: {.fragment}
::: {.r-fit-text}
Institute-wide roll-out: **Who does it?**
:::
:::

::: {.incremental}
- Who decides? Who takes responsibility?
- Institutional process are slow and other issues take priority
- Need is not great enough?
  - Recruiting young + healthy participants is easy
  - There are "competitors"
    - SONA + test subjects hours (participants "for free")
    - Stellenwerk (popular website for student jobs)
    - Flyers in the mensa
  - Accustomed to suboptimal processes?
:::

::: {.fragment}
... stay tuned!

## Community Goal: Process Documentation

# Discussion

## Challenges for the task force

::: {.incremental}
- Everyone understand how Castellum works and what it *currently* does (not) offer
  - {{< fa notes-medical >}} Presentation and overview of Castellum with opportunity to ask questions
  - {{< fa notes-medical >}} Collect resources in one central place (e.g., website)
  - {{< fa notes-medical >}} Set-up a test-installation that is easy to access
- Get all stakeholders on board and well-informed
  - *"I have to discuss this with my group leader first."*
  - *"I'll ask around in my group and give you feedback next time."* 
- Diverse groups = diverse needs
  - *"We will only use Castellum if we can easily recruit teams of participants."*
- Castellum has to be significantly better than what a group is currently using
- Diffusion of responsibility
- Benefits of investing into a common resource
- (Active) participation in the task force is an extra burden for (scientific, junior) staff
:::

::: {.notes}
- embrace (the idea of) open-source
:::

## Example: Integration of existing participant databases and access

::: {.incremental}
- It took time and effort to build current participant database
- Worries about free-riders
- Worries that precious participants are going to be contacted too frequently
  - How can access to certain participant groups be reserved for certain research groups?
- Worries about legal aspects and data-privacy ("*Can we even share contact details from our existing database?*")
- Unclear if participant consent allows transfer to Castellum
- *"We have a working solution. What's our benefit of investing into Castellum?"*
:::

## Summary

::: {.fragment}
### Next steps
:::
::: {.incremental}
- {{< fa square regular >}} Create user agreement, prepare data protection whitepaper, etc.
- {{< fa square regular >}} Compliance with requirements by data protection officer
- {{< fa square regular >}} Finalize implementation of automated sign-ups, bulk-upload of existing databases
:::

::: {.fragment}
### Lessons learned (so far)
:::
::: {.incremental}
- Involve data protection officer from the start
- Inform *all* faculty members early and in detail
- Have IT on board
- Aim for implementation (or at least documentation) not (only) discussion
:::
